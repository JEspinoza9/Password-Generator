 Purpose: The purpose of this application is to generate a random password based on criteria that the user inputs. The user chooses the length of the password and answers a series of prompts. The prompts ask if the user would like to include upper case, lower case, numbers, and special charactrs in their password. By setting these options to arrays and setting a function to choose random characters from each list that the user would like to include in the password.
