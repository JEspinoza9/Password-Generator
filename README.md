Sources: For this activity i was having trouble with the functions to randomly choose numbers. fortunately one of my class mates had amazing code and clear notes i was able to refrence.
 Here is his GitHub project : https://kurtbixby.github.io/Boot-Camp-Challenge-03-Password-Generator/


 Purpose: The purpose of this application is to generate a random password based on criteria that the user inputs. The user chooses the length of the password and answers a series of prompts. The prompts ask if the user would like to include upper case, lower case, numbers, and special charactrs in their password. By setting these options to arrays and setting a function to choose random characters from each list that the user would like to include in the password. 

here is the link to my deployed application:  https://jespinoza9.github.io/Password-Generator/

I had issues with my previous repo only displaying my read me file and not the application. I created a new repo which is why there are no commits on this repo.
